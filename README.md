# Black-Box-Recorder
Black Box Recorder is an advanced tool designed to function as a 24/7 audio recorder with robust encryption. It has been engineered to serve as a reliable source of evidence to validate someone's innocence or establish guilt.

Every recording captured by Black Box Recorder:
- is automatically erased after a 24-hour cycle, unless specifically saved or shared by the user. This helps maintain your device's storage while respecting privacy.
- Has a maximum duration of 20 minutes per clip, a necessary condition owing to Android's system constraints.
