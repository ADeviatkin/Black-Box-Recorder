# Alpha Black Box 

This is open-source project designed by students for people who prefer to be better prepared for unforeseen incident. 

## Description
The main idea behind the app is to create something, that can provide you by evidence of a crime for the court. Depending on the legislation of your country, it may be legal to record what's happening around you, especially if It's illegal. Unfortunately, we can't foresee what and when will happen wrong, but with the app like that, you literally going to record everything what is going on, whatever It's good or bad.
